The goal of this project is to create a distributed live cycle management system.
By combining multiple 0-Robots, each of them focusing on a specific purpose. We can create a distributed network of robots that manages nodes and applications.
A robot is responsible for orchestrating different entities that we call 'services'. A service's purpose is to model anything required to manage your IT environments.  
A service can map to something physical, like a server or an network card, or it can model something more abstract like a virtual machine or a capacity planner.
